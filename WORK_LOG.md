| Sep 3 | 9:30-10:30 PM  |          I tried an approach where I had a recursive helper method that takes in a start cell and tells me how long it |
|       |                | would take to get to the end of the board from that cell. That approach didn't really work the way I wanted it to, but |
| Sep 4 | 10:00-10:40 PM |                                                                    it did help me understand the problem a lot better. |
|       |                |                         I ditched the helper method approach and instead did something similar to the mazesolvers from |
|       |                |                  last year, where I had an ArrayList of all the seen cells and all the "currently exploring" cells and |
|       |                |                         used those to find new cells to explore. I'm now passing 4/4 tests and have done a tiny little |
|       |                |                                                                                       bit of optimizing, but not much. |
